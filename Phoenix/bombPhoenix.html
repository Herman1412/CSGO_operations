          <p class="text textCenter">Cache (de_cache) is a custom Bomb Defusal map featured in Operation Bravo and in Operation Phoenix, available in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. Originally a custom map for Counter-Strike: Source, it was remade for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with rebalances to fix the original's Terrorist-sided issues.
            The map takes place in Pripyat, Ukraine. The Chernobyl Power Plant is visible from the Terrorist spawn, along with nearby buildings and even fencing material consistent with the real-life counterpart.</p>

It, along with six other maps, were released as a part of Valve's Operation Payback. Only minor gameplay tweaks have been made since its initial release. On the October 13, 2016 Update, the map was removed from the game files, making Favela inaccessible via console.</p>
