          <h2>Downtown</h2>
          <img class="mapPic"src="../bilder/maps/downtown.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="text textCenter">Downtown is a custom hostage rescue map featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's Operation Payback and Operation Phoenix. The map takes place in and around a bank (indicated by the destroyed vault), probably in San Francisco. It features high value choke points and long corridors.
            On the October 13, 2016 Update, the map was removed from the game files, making Downtown inaccessible via console. The map was created by Tanuki and uploaded to the Maps Workshop on February 7, 2013. Since then, only minor changes have been made, by fixing glitches, updating hostages, and improving aesthetics. Due to its popularity, it was included with Operation Payback on April 25, 2013.</p>

          <img class="mapPic"src="../bilder/maps/motel.png" alt="">
          <p class="text textCenter">Motel is a custom hostage rescue map featured in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive's Operation Payback and Operation Phoenix. The map is based around a diner, motel, and a parking lot that links the two. The motel itself has two floors with numerous small rooms, some of them being hostage spawns. It also includes a small pool. It was created by Soctom and uploaded to the Maps Workshop on January 23, 2013. The signs, found in various parts of the play area, were created by Cocyx. The map has undergone extensive changes: adding (and later manipulating) the 3D skybox, moving objects around, adding stairs, creating new soundscapes, swapping hostage spawns, and much more. On the October 13, 2016 Update, the map was removed from the game files, making Motel inaccessible via console.</p>

          <img class="mapPic"src="../bilder/maps/Thunder.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="text textCenter">Thunder (cs_thunder) is an official hostage rescue map included in Counter-Strike 1.1. A community remake was included in Operation Payback and Operation Phoenix of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. The map takes place on a dam and its surrounding facilities. The dam itself features long sight lines with very little cover. The interior, on the other hand, contains small hallways and large rooms. The map was designed by Chris "Barney" Auty. It was built in 2 weeks and was finished to be included in version 1.0, but was not included in the game until version 1.1 due to time constraints[2]. Custom textures for the map were provided by "jOeSmOe". In Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, on the October 13, 2016 Update, the map was removed from the game files, making Thunder inaccessible via console.</p>
