          <p class="text textCenter">Black Gold (de_blackgold) is a community created Bomb Defusal map designed by az, Holiest Cow and The Horse Strangler and featured as part of Operation Breakout and Operation Hydra in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.The map was removed from the game files in October 13, 2016 update, but returned during May 23, 2017 for Operation Hydra. The conflict takes place on a oil rig located in the ocean.
            Care must be taken when maneuvering around the edges of the map as players will instantly die if they jump outside the railings.
            This map features many climbable shipping containers and platforms for height advantage. The outside area is open while the bombsites favor close combat.</p>

In the March 15, 2017 update, the thumbnail of the map was added to the game files. The map was originally developed by BubkeZ (creator of Mirage) as Mirage 2 (de_mirage2), a project he had worked on for Counter-Strike 1.6 since 2011 and released in 2015.[2] FMPONE wanted to port Mirage 2 to Global Offensive, but due to working on Santorini he cannot spend time on Mirage 2. Instead, Squad and Yanzl worked with BubkeZ to create Thrill for Global Offensive with a new theme.</p>
