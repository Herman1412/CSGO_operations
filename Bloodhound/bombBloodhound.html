          <p class="text textCenter">Season (de_season) is a community created map featured heavily in professional competitive play since its creation for Counter-Strike: Source. It has since been included as part of Operation Vanguard in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
          On the October 13, 2016 Update, the map was removed from the game files, making Season inaccessible via console. The conflict is occurring within a bio-research facility in Tokyo, Japan. Mount Fuji is visible in the distance in the skybox. The map features clean aesthetics with a significant usage of white and other simple, bright whole colors.
          The Counter-Terrorist force is the SAS and the Terrorist force is the Phoenix Connexion.</p>
