          <img class="mapPic"src="../bilder/maps/cobblestone.jpg" alt="">
          <p class="text textCenter">Cobblestone (de_cbble), formerly known as Cobble, is a bomb defusal map featured in the Counter-Strike series. It was added to Counter-Strike: Global Offensive in the Winter Offensive update alongside the map Overpass. Cobblestone is a large-sized map, and had quite significant vertical combat in its earlier iterations. In earlier versions, it is fairly easy to take fall damage due to the high height of many of the map's drops. Bots in early versions of the game will also occasionally fall to their deaths. Additionally, this map is open, making snipers very useful. The map was designed by David Johnston after completing Dust.</p>

The map's setting is a canal overpass and the park built above it in Berlin, Germany. The GSG-9 must protect a stalled military shipment on a canal overpass while the Phoenix Connexion can either attack the shipment head-on or attempt to destroy the overpass itself by bombing the pillar below.</p>
